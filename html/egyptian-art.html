<h4><b>Art of ancien Egypt</b></h4>
<p>
Ancient Egyptian art refers art produced in ancient Egypt between the 31st century BC and the 4th century AD. 
It includes paintings, sculptures, drawings on papyrus, faience, jewelry, ivories, architecture, and other art media. It is also very conservative: the art style changed very little over time. 
Much of the surviving art comes from tombs and monuments, giving more insight into the Egyptians' belief of the afterlife.

<p>
  The Ancient Egyptian language had no word for "art". 
  Artworks served an essentially functional purpose that was bound with religion and ideology. To render a subject in art was to give it permanence. 
  Hence, ancient Egyptian art portrayed an idealized, unrealistic view of the world. 
  There was no tradition of individual artistic expression since art served a wider and cosmic purpose of maintaining order.

<h4><b>Egyptomania</b></h4>
<p>
  Egyptomania was the renewed interest of Europeans in ancient Egypt during the nineteenth century as a result of Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign (1798–1801) and, in particular, as a result of the extensive scientific study of ancient Egyptian remains and culture inspired by this campaign. 
  In addition to its aesthetic impact on literature, art, and architecture, it also played a role in the discussion about race, gender, and national identity. 
  Egyptomania is of particular importance to American culture because of the way in which the example of ancient Egypt served to create a sense of independent nationhood during the nineteenth century.
  However, Egypt has had a significant impact on the cultural imagination of all Western cultures.
