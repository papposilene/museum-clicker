  Cabinets of curiosities (also known in German loanwords as <em>Kunstkabinett</em>, <em>Kunstkammer</em> or <em>Wunderkammer</em>; also Cabinets of Wonder, and wonder-rooms) were notable collections of objects.

  The term cabinet originally described a room rather than a piece of furniture. 
  Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings), and antiquities. 
  The classic cabinet of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century, although more rudimentary collections had existed earlier. 
  In addition to the most famous and best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums.
