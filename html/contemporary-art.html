  <h4>The Contemporary Art</h4>
  <p>
    Contemporary art is the art of today, produced in the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century.
    Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world.
    Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century.
    Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or "-ism".
    Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.
