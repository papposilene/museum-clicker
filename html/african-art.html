    African art describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous Africans and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the African diasporas, such as African American, Caribbean or art in South American societies inspired by African traditions. 
    Despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present, when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of Africa.

    African art has had an important influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction. 
    It was this appreciation of African sculpture that has been attributed to the very concept of "African art", as seen by European and American artists and art historians.
