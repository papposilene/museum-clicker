<h4><b>Museum</b></h4>
<p>
A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance. 
Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. 
The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. 
Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.

<h4><b>Collections</b></h4>
<p>
  A museum is distinguished by a collection of often unique objects that forms the core of its activities for exhibitions, education, research, etc. 
  This differentiates it from an archive or library, where the contents may be more paper-based, replaceable and less exhibition oriented, or a private collection of art formed by an individual, family or institution that may grant no public access. 
  A museum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection. 
  The process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called accessioning and each object is given a unique accession number.
