    Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophy of the art produced during that era.
    The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.
    Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art.
    A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. 
    More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art.
